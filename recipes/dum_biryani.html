        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong><p>In a large bowl, combine the chicken pieces, onion, bell pepper, ginger, garlic, garam masala powder, turmeric powder,</p>
                <p>chili powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, yogurt, vegetable oil, and salt.</p>
                <p> Mix well and coat the chicken pieces thoroughly. Cover the bowl and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours,</p>
                    preferably overnight for deeper flavors.</p></li>

            <li><strong>Cook the Rice:</strong><p>In a separate pot, bring a large amount of salted water to a boil.</p>
                <p>Add the rinsed and soaked Basmati rice and cook until it's about 80% done (slightly firm to the bite).
                Drain the rice and set it aside.</p></li>

            <li><strong>Assemble the Biryani:</strong><p>Heat ghee or vegetable oil in a heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven suitable for oven use.</p>
                <p>Add the bay leaf, cloves, green cardamoms, black cardamom (if using), and cinnamon stick. Saute for a few seconds until fragrant.</p></li>

            <li><strong>Brown the Chicken:</strong><p>Remove the marinated chicken from the yogurt mixture and add it to the hot oil in the pot.</p>
                <p> Sear the chicken pieces on all sides until golden brown.</p></li>

            <li><strong>Add Remaining Marinade:</strong><p>Pour the remaining yogurt marinade over the browned chicken pieces in the pot.</p>
                <p>Bring to a simmer and cook for about 10 minutes, allowing the flavors to develop.</p></li>

            <li><strong>Layer the Biryani:</strong><p>Spread half of the cooked rice over the chicken and sauce in the pot. Season with salt.</p>
                <p> Top with half of the fried onions (if using), cashews, and golden raisins.</p></li>

            <li><strong>Repeat the Layers:</strong><p>Add the remaining rice, followed by another layer of salt, fried onions (if using), cashews, and raisins.</p></li>
                
            <li><strong>Seal the Pot:</strong><p>Cover the pot tightly with a lid. You can also create a seal with foil placed over the lid to trap steam.</p></li>
                
            <li><strong>Dum Cooking:</strong><p>Place the pot in a preheated oven at 200°C (400°F) for 20-25 minutes.</p>
                <p>This slow cooking allows the flavors and aromas to blend beautifully.</p></li>
                
            <li><strong>Rest and Serve:</strong><p>After cooking, remove the pot from the oven and let it rest for another 10 minutes with the lid on.</p>
                <p>This allows the rice to absorb the remaining flavors. Gently fluff the rice with a fork before serving.</p></li>
                
            <li><strong>Garnish and Enjoy:</strong><p>Garnish the Chicken Dum Biryani with chopped cilantro leaves and serve hot with raita (yogurt-based condiment) or a side salad.</p></li>
                  
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips:</h2>

        <ul>
            <li><p>If using boneless, skinless chicken pieces, adjust the cooking time accordingly as they cook faster.</p></li>
            <li><p>For a richer flavor, caramelize the onions before adding them to the pot. </p></li>
            <li><p>You can substitute the vegetables in the marinade with chopped tomatoes for a tangy twist.</p></li>
            <li><p>Remember, spice is subjective! Adjust the amount of chili powder to your desired level of heat. </p></li>
            
        </ul>
