        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Soak the Rice and Dal:</strong><p>In a large bowl, combine the rinsed rice, urad dal, and fenugreek seeds.</p>
                <p>Wash them together thoroughly. Add enough water to cover them by about 2 inches. Soak for at least 6-8 hours, or preferably overnight.</p></li>
            
            <li><strong>Grind the Batter:</strong><p>After soaking, drain the water from the rice and dal mixture. Grind it into a smooth batter using a blender or grinder.</p>
                <p>Add water gradually while grinding to achieve a slightly thick, pourable consistency (like thin pancake batter).</p>
                <p>Add the salt and mix well. Cover the batter and let it ferment in a warm place for 8-10 hours, or until it doubles in volume and becomes slightly bubbly.</li>

            <li><strong>Prepare the Masala:</strong><p>In a pan, heat oil over medium heat. Add the mustard seeds and cumin seeds.</p>
                <p>When they begin to splutter, add the curry leaves. Let them crackle for a few seconds.</p></li>      
            
            <li><strong>Sauté the Aromatics:</strong><p>Add the chopped onion, green chili pepper (if using), ginger, and garlic to the pan.</p>
                <p> Sauté until the onions become translucent and softened, about 5 minutes.</p></li>

            <li><strong>Spice it Up:</strong><p>Add the turmeric powder, coriander powder, and red chili powder to the pan.</p>
                <p>Stir and cook for a minute, allowing the spices to release their aroma.</p></li>
            
            <li><strong>Incorporate the Potatoes:</strong><p>Add the mashed potatoes and salt to the pan. Mix well and cook for 5-7 minutes,</p>
                <p>until the filling is heated through and flavors are combined. Mash any large potato pieces for a smoother texture.</p></li> 
            
            <li><strong>Cook the Dosa:</strong><p>Heat a flat griddle or non-stick pan over medium heat. Once hot,</p>
                <p>dip a ladle or measuring cup into the fermented batter and swirl it to coat the bottom of the pan thinly and evenly.</p>
                <p> Drizzle a few drops of oil around the edges of the dosa.</p></li>
            
            <li><strong>Crisp it Up:</strong><p>Let the dosa cook for a minute or two, until the bottom becomes slightly golden brown and the edges start to loosen.</p></li>

            <li><strong>Fill and Fold:</strong><p>Spread a spoonful of the prepared potato masala in the center of the cooked dosa.</p>
                <p>Use a spatula to gently fold the dosa in half, like a crescent moon. Press down slightly to secure the filling.</p></li>
            
            <li><strong>Serve Hot:</strong><p>Cook for another minute or two on both sides, until the dosa is crispy and golden brown.</p>
                <p>Slide the masala dosa onto a plate and serve hot with coconut chutney or sambar (a lentil and vegetable stew), and garnish with chopped cilantro leaves.</p></li>

        </ol>

        <h2>Tips:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>To ensure crispy dosas, make sure your griddle or pan is hot enough before cooking.</p></li>
            <li><p>If the batter seems too thick, add a little water to thin it out. Conversely, if it's too thin, let it ferment for a longer time. </p></li>
            <li><p>You can adjust the amount of chili powder depending on your desired level of spice.</p></li>
            <li><p>Leftover dosa batter can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 days.</p></li>
