            <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon red chili powder (adjust to your spice preference)</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>

        <li><strong>Make the Dough:</strong><p>In a large bowl, combine the flour and salt. Add the vegetable oil and mix it in using your fingertips until it resembles coarse crumbs.</p>
            <p> Gradually add water, a tablespoon at a time, kneading until a soft and pliable dough forms. You might not need all the water.</p></li>

        <li><strong>Knead and Rest:</strong><p>Knead the dough for 5-7 minutes on a lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic.</p>
            <p>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for at least 30 minutes.</p></li>

        <li><strong>Prepare the Filling:</strong><p>In a large pan, heat a tablespoon of vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and green chili pepper (if using) and saute until softened and translucent.
            <p>Add the ginger and garlic and cook for another minute, until fragrant.</p></li>

        <li><strong>Spice it Up:</strong><p>Add the garam masala powder, cumin powder, turmeric powder, and red chili powder to the pan.</p> 
            <p>Stir and cook for a minute, allowing the spices to release their aroma.</p></li>

        <li><strong>Incorporate the Vegetables:</strong><p>Add the mashed potatoes, peas, and salt to the pan. Mix well and cook for 5-7 minutes, until the filling is heated through and flavors are combined.</p>
            <p>Remove the pan from the heat and let the filling cool slightly.</p></li>

        <li><strong>Assemble the Samosas:</strong><p>Divide the dough into equal portions and roll each portion into a thin circle on a lightly floured surface.</p>
            <p>Use a saucer or cookie cutter to cut out circles from the dough.</p></li>

        <li><strong>Fill and Fold:</strong><p>Place a spoonful of the cooled filling in the center of each dough circle. Moisten the edges with a little water to seal.</p>
            <p>Fold the circle into a half-moon shape, pressing the edges firmly to seal. You can also fold them into triangle shapes.</p></li>

        <li><strong>Heat the Oil:</strong><p>Heat enough oil in a deep pan or fryer for frying. The ideal temperature is around 180°C (350°F).</p></li>

        <li><strong>Fry the Samosas:</strong><p>Gently slide the samosas into the hot oil and fry in batches until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 3-4 minutes per batch.</p></li>

        <li><strong>Drain and Serve:</strong><p>Remove the fried samosas from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels to remove excess oil.</p>
            <p>Serve hot with your favorite chutney or dipping sauce, like mint chutney or tamarind chutney.</p></li>
 
        </ol>

        <h2>Tips:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>For extra crispy samosas, double fry them. Fry them once at a lower temperature (around 160°C/320°F) until slightly golden,</p>
                <p>then fry them again at a higher temperature (around 180°C/350°F) for a final crisp.</p></li>

            <li><p>If the dough feels too dry, add a little more water while kneading. If it feels sticky, add a little more flour.</p></li>
            <li><p>You can adjust the amount of chili powder depending on your desired level of spice.</p></li>

            <li><p>Feel free to experiment with different fillings! Some variations include minced meat, lentils, or a combination of vegetables.</p></li>
